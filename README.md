# Barcelona_AirBnb_Data_Analisys

Analisys of AirBnb listings in Barcelona city.

# Motivation

This project try to answer diferent questions through data analisys related to AirBnb bussines in Barcelona city:

1. Which neighbourhood are in the city and which are your features?
2. Which is the median availability in days per year of each apartment according the district and type of room?
3. Which is the occupation of apartments per month in the last two years?
4. Which are the prices according the type of room and district in the city?
